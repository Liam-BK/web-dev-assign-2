There is no check to make sure the date and time entered by the user haven't already passed.

When updating the assigned part of the database, the page will need to be refreshed in order for the results to show onscreen.

To search the database, you will need to first go to admin.html. I have put the url conveniently at the bottom of the file. Then you will need to enter BRN + whatever reference number you require.
 
If you wish to add a booking to the database, you will need to enter the url for booking.html. 
this url can be found at the bottom of the booking.html file like the rest of my files.

I have added "required" tags to the essential form elements in booking.html. however, this does not seem to stop the page from submitting empty data to the database, though the booking reference number as well as date and time are still correctly added.
